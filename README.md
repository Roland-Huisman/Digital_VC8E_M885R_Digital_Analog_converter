Digital VC8E M885R Point Plot Controller D/A converter

This is a 74xx clone of the Digital VC8E M885R Point Plot D/A converter for the DEC PDP8/E family computers. 
It's called the VC8E M885R. Please note, this is a two board set. You need the VC8E M869R controller as well...

If you happen to have an original M869 board, you can use it together with the VC8E M885R D/A converter.

There are no DEC or SP chips used. Only 74xx and 74HCTxx series chips are used. It passes the VC8E maindec test.

I hope to do some more redesigns of several Omnibus boards. Prices are getting insane and in this way you can build as many boards as you want to have. If you want to built these boards and sell them on Ebay, you are more then welcome to do that. In this way you can help other people to get these boards which probably are not able to solder them by them self.

All documents are profided as-is. I have to check which lisence is the best suitable for the project.

Regards, Roland
